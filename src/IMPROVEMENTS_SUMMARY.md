# ✅ Quiz Improvements Summary

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### **1. Scoring Bug - FIXED ✅**

**Problem:** Students were getting extra points (e.g., 4 instead of 3)

**Root Cause:** In both `PagbabalikaralScreen.tsx` and `QuizScreen.tsx`, the score was being calculated twice:
- Line 98: `setScore(score + 1)` when showing feedback
- Line 102: `score + 1` again when completing quiz

**Fix:** Changed line 103 in both files:
```tsx
// BEFORE (WRONG):
const finalScore = selectedAnswer === question.correctAnswer ? score + 1 : score;
onComplete(finalScore);

// AFTER (CORRECT):
onComplete(score); // Just pass current score, don't add again
```

**Result:** Scoring now works correctly! ✅

## ✨ New Features

### **2. Back to Menu Option - ADDED ✅**

**What:** After completing Bahagi 1 (Pagbabalik-aral), students can now:
- ✅ Continue to Bahagi 2 (as before)
- ✅ **NEW:** Go back to main menu

**How it works:**
- Added `onBackToMenu` prop to `UnlockedScreen.tsx`
- New button: "Bumalik sa Menu" with Home icon
- Resets all state when clicked
- Returns to welcome screen

**Why:** Gives students flexibility to take a break between parts!

## 🎨 Design Improvements

### **3. Complete Visual Redesign - DONE ✅**

**Problems with old design:**

- ❌ Heavy animations (floating fish, waves, bubbles) - distracting
- ❌ Cluttered UI with too many visual elements
- ❌ Inconsistent color schemes between screens
- ❌ Hard to focus on questions

**New Clean Design:**
- ✅ **Professional color palette:**
  - Blue (#3B82F6) - Primary actions & Bahagi 1
  - Indigo (#6366F1) - Bahagi 2

  - Red (#EF4444) - Wrong answers
  - Yellow (#F59E0B) - Stars/achievements
  - Gray - Neutral backgrounds

  - Clean white cards with subtle shadows
  - Soft gradient backgrounds (barely noticeable)
  - Consistent rounded corners (xl = 12px, 2xl = 16px, 3xl = 24px)
  - Better spacing and breathing room

- ✅ **Minimal animations:**
  - Removed: Floating fish, wave animations, heavy bubble effects
  - Kept: Simple fade-in, scale effects, progress bars
  - Added: Confetti only on success (auto-removes after 3s)

- ✅ **Better readability:**
  - Larger, clearer text
  - Higher contrast
  - Clean sans-serif fonts
  - Better line spacing

- ✅ **Consistent components:**
  - All screens follow same design system
  - Same button styles everywhere
