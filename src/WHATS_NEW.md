## 💾 Database Considerations

### Current Setup
- **Saves:** Part 2 score only (5 questions)
- **Reason:** Part 1 is practice, Part 2 is the "real" test

### Alternative Option
You can save both scores if you want:
- Edit `handleQuizComplete` in App.tsx
- Save combined score (15 questions total)
- Or save separate Part 1 and Part 2 scores

See [TWO_PART_QUIZ_GUIDE.md](./TWO_PART_QUIZ_GUIDE.md) for how to do this.

✅ **Teacher dashboard** - Still at /admin  
✅ **Score saving** - Still works with Supabase
